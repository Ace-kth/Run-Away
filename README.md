# RUN AWAY - Co-op Game

This repository contains the source code for a co-op game developed using SDL2 library. The game is a cat-and-mouse style game where runners try to avoid being captured by the hunters.


## Development Team:

We are a team of five students from KTH Royal Institute of Technology who collaborated on this project as part of our school assignment.


## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_net, and SDL_ttf libraries installed on your system. You can install these libraries using your system's package manager or by downloading them from their respective websites.

Once you have the required libraries installed, you can compile and run the game by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
make OR mingw32-make.exe 
./game
```


## Gameplay

The game is played by up to five players, each controlling a character on the screen. The objective of the game is that the hunters try to catch all runners before the the time runs out.

Players can move their characters using the arrow keys and can use perks scattered throughout the map to gain an advantage over their opponents. The game ends when all runners are captured or when the time runs out.
